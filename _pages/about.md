### About Me

Hello! I'm Julien Bastian, an aspiring researcher with a passion for applied mathematics and machine learning. I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree at the  **Université Lyon 2**, where I've also completed my Bachelor's in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.

My academic journey has always leaned towards the theoretical aspects of machine learning. To delve deeper into this realm, I undertook two research internships. During my third year, I embarked on my first research endeavor, followed by a more extensive internship in my fourth year. Both of these experiences enriched my understanding and strengthened my foundations in theoretical aspects of my field.

### Academic Achievements

- **Master's in Applied Mathematics (Ongoing)**: Université Lyon 2, Lyon. Specializing in machine learning with a focus on research.
- **Bachelor's in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science**: Université Lyon 2, Lyon. Laid the groundwork for my interest in theoretical machine learning.

### Research Internships

1. **Third Year Research Internship**: This was my first step into academic research. During this two month internship I studied Convolutional Neural Networks and Continuous Wavelet Transformation techniques to enhance heartbeat classification using electrocardiograms.
  
2. **Fourth Year Research Internship**: A continuation of my research journey and a deep dive into this. During this 6 month period, I studied PAC-Bayesian theory and its specification for Domain Adaptation, under the supervision [Guillaume Metzler](https://guillaumemetzler.github.io/), [Emilie Morvant](https://emorvant.github.io/) and Marie-Ange Lèbre we developped a novel Generalization bound on data representation for Domain Adaptation.

### Future Ambitions

My experiences have fueled my ambition to contribute to the research community. As I continue my studies, I aim to work on topics in applied mathematics and machine learning. At the moment I am looking for a 6 month research internship for the end of my master degree and a PHD position for next year.
