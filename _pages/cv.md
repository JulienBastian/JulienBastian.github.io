Research internships
======
March - July 2023: Random Fourier Features for PAC-Bayesian Domain Adaptation. [project link](https://julienbastian.github.io//portfolio/portfolio-1/)\
I was a research intern under the supervision of Guillaume Metzler from ERIC laboratory in Lyon, Emilie Morvant and Marie-Ange LÃ¨bre from Hubert Curien laboratory in St-Etienne during 5 months. 
  * Literature review :  Domain Adaptation and PAC Bayesian Learning and the preliminary work based on Random Fourier Features
  * Theoretical : A novel bound for kernel approximation for Domain Adaptation
  * Practical: Implementation and evaluation of the proposed algorithm

May - June 2022 : Learning Representations for Wavelets, an Application to ECG Classification. [project link](https://julienbastian.github.io//portfolio/portfolio-2/)
  * Literature review : Deep learning fundamentals, representation learning, Wavelets
  * Theoretical : Adaptation of two deep neural networks architecture for electrocardiogram (ECG)
  * Practical : Implementation of deep neural networks (TensorFlow) and evaluation of the proposed models
