**March - July 2023: Random Fourier Features for PAC-Bayesian Domain Adaptation.** [project page](https://julienbastian.github.io//portfolio/portfolio-1/)

I was a research intern under the supervision of Guillaume Metzler from ERIC laboratory in Lyon, Emilie Morvant and Marie-Ange LÃ¨bre from Hubert Curien laboratory in St-Etienne during 5 months. 
  * **Literature review** :  Domain Adaptation and PAC Bayesian Learning and the preliminary work based on Random Fourier Features
  * **Theoretical** : A novel bound for kernel approximation for Domain Adaptation
  * **Practical** : Implementation and evaluation of the proposed algorithm
