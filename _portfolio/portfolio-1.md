During this internship, supervised by [Guillaume Metzler](https://guillaumemetzler.github.io/) from [ERIC laboratory](https://eric.msh-lse.fr/) in Lyon, [Emilie Morvant](https://emorvant.github.io/) and Marie-Ange LÃ¨bre from the [Hubert Curien laboratory](https://laboratoirehubertcurien.univ-st-etienne.fr/en/the-lab/edito.html) in Saint-Etienne, we worked on the PAC-Bayesian theory and its specification for Domain Adaptation. Centering on kernel approximation methods and data representation, we took the standpoint of Random Fourier Features (RFF). Using RFF, we found a new way to look at the pseudo-kernel by develloping a novel PAC-Bayesian bound on the quality of the representation in the target domain. This proposition showed promising results when benchmarked against other PAC-Bayesian techniques for Domain Adaptation on Toy datasets.
