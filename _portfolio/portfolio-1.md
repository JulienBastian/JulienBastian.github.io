title: "Random Fourier Features for PAC-Bayesian Domain Adaptation"
excerpt: Building on PAC-Bayesian theory for Domain Adaptation, the research emphasizes kernel approximation methods with  Random Fourier Features, to enhance data representation for classification in target domains without labels. We developped a novel PAC-Bayesian for this set-up and derived a learning algorithm. <br/>  <br/>"

During this internship, supervised by [Guillaume Metzler](https://guillaumemetzler.github.io/), [Emilie Morvant](https://emorvant.github.io/) and Marie-Ange LÃ¨bre, we worked on the PAC-Bayesian theory and its specification for Domain Adaptation. Centering on kernel approximation methods and data representation, we took the standpoint of Random Fourier Features. Using Random Fourier Features, we found a new way to look at the pseudo-kernel by develloping a novel PAC-Bayesian bound on the quality of the representation in the target domain. from this bound we derived a learning algorithm. This proposition showed promising results when benchmarked against other PAC-Bayesian techniques for Domain Adaptation on Toy datasets.
